For [**CHALLENGE WIKI**](https://github.com/MrReedSWCHS/Sonic-Pi/wiki) click here\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n##Hints and Help\r\n\r\n###Looping\r\n\r\nLoops start with `loop do` and end with `end`\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nloop do\r\n  play 80\r\n  sleep 1\r\nend\r\n```\r\n##Don't get trapped! Use `in_thread`\r\n\r\nOnce your loop starts it will not stop until you press STOP. To make your loop run with the next thing down in your code you can use `in_thread`.\r\n\r\nHere the loop and the sample will start at the same time.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nin_thread do\r\n  loop do\r\n    play 80\r\n    sleep 1\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\nsample :bd_zome\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you have LOTS of things starting at the same time, you will need an `in_thread` on everything except the bottom thing:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nin_thread do\r\n  loop do\r\n    play 80\r\n    sleep 1\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\nin_thread do\r\n  sample :bd_zome\r\nend\r\n\r\nsample :ambi_drone\r\n```\r\n\r\n##Repeats\r\n\r\nInstead of looping forever you can use `10.times` to say repeat something 10 times.\r\n\r\nYou still need a `do` and `end`:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n10.times do\r\n  play 80\r\n  sleep 1\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n###Numbers or Notes?\r\n\r\nYou can play numbers or note names. `play 60` is the same as `play :c4`.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n##Want more ideas?\r\n\r\nIf these are too simple for you, you need to look at the [**Challenge Wiki**](https://github.com/MrReedSWCHS/Sonic-Pi/wiki)\r\n",
